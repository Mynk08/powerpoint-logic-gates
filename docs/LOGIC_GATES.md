# Logic Gates in PowerPoint

## Implemented Gates

### AND Gate
- Uses two input slides (ON/OFF states)
- Hyperlinks route based on both inputs
- Output slide shows result

### OR Gate
- Either input being ON produces ON output
- Multiple hyperlink paths converge

### NOT Gate
- Inverts input state
- Single input, inverted output

### XOR Gate
- Output ON when inputs differ
- Composite of other gates

## Slide Structure
Each gate uses 4-8 slides for state representation.
