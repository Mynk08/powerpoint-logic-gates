# Technical Implementation

## Hyperlink Logic
PowerPoint hyperlinks support:
- Slide-to-slide navigation
- Conditional paths based on user clicks
- State representation through slide sequences

## Limitations
- Manual execution (click-based)
- State limited to slide history
- No automatic computation
- Visual only output

## Future Extensions
- Complex circuits (full adders)
- Memory elements (flip-flops)
- Counters and state machines
